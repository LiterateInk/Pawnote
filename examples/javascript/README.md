# Pawnote - Examples in JavaScript

We use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) here to run the examples but you can use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [`tsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx) (`npm install --global tsx`).

```bash
pnpm start # to run with Node.js + tsx
# or
bun run . # to run with Bun
```

Each sub-directory is a specific example that you can run.
