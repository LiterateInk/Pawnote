Works out of the box, in both CommonJS (CJS) and ESM.

### Browser, Tauri, Capacitor

Works out of the box, in both CommonJS (CJS) and ESM but please note that CORS might be an issue if you run this library in a web browser such as Chrome, Firefox and many others.

### React Native

You might need to install [`react-native-webassembly`](https://github.com/cawfree/react-native-webassembly) to use this package.

Should work out of the box with the right configuration, but it's not tested yet.
